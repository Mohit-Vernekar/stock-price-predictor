# stock-price-predictor
A repository for my stock price predictor project.

This project uses a LSTM model to analyze the historical closing price of a company's stocks and makes a prediction for its future closing price. 
The result is then graphically depicted on a dashboard.
The user can also compare the stock data of various tech giants such as Tesla, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft.

Project synopsis and report has been included.


Python version: Python 3.8.5
